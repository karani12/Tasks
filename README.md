# Task Management System

The Task Management System is a web application built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize ORM, and JWT authentication. It allows users to log tasks, categorize them, assign tasks to users, and send notifications upon task completion.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register, login, and logout securely using JWT authentication.
- **Task Management:** Users can create tasks, categorize them by priority, assign tasks to users, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Role-Based Access:** Admin users have the privilege to create tasks, while regular users can only view and manage their assigned tasks.
- **Database Storage:** Data is stored in a SQLite database, ensuring reliability and scalability.
- **Data Validation:** Input data is validated using express-validator to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Rate Limiting:** Middleware is implemented to prevent abuse through rate limiting.
